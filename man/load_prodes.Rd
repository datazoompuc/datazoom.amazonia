}
\arguments{
\item{source}{A number of different sources are supported:

Passing a numeric \code{vector} of years will download the corresponding data from the INPE website (data is organized by prodes-year - from august to july - for more information, see the vignette).

Passing a \code{string} with a directory's path will read data from all files named
"\{path\}/DesmatamentoMunicipiosXXXX.txt".

Alternatively, \code{source} may be a list of full file paths, or anything else readable by \code{utils::read.csv()}.}

\item{space_aggregation}{A string that indicates the level of aggregation of the data. It can be by "Municipality" or
"State".}

\item{language}{A string that indicates in which language the data will be returned. The default is "eng", so your data will be returned in English.
The other option is "pt" for Portuguese.}
