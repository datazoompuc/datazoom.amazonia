# Environmental Data

## PRODES

The PRODES project uses satellites to monitor deforestation in Brazil’s
Legal Amazon. The raw data reports total and incremental (year-by-year)
low-cut deforested area at the municipality level, going back to the
year 2000.

Data is collected based on the PRODES-year, which starts at August 1st
and ends on July 31st. Accordingly, 2018 deforestation data covers the
period from 01/08/2017 to 31/07/2018.

INPE’s most recent data is now published at
[TerraBrasilis](http://terrabrasilis.dpi.inpe.br/downloads/). We have
refrained from updating to this new source, as it only contains detailed
spatial data, rather than agregated, municipality-level data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: `"deforestation"`

2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:

    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.

3.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# Download treated data (raw_data = FALSE)
# in portuguese (language = 'pt').
data <- load_prodes(raw_data = FALSE,
                    language = 'pt')  
```

## DETER

[DETER](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/deter/deter)
uses satellite surveillance to detect and report changes in forest cover
across the Legal Amazon and the Cerrado biome. Each data point consists
of a warning, describing which type of change has affected a certain
area of forest at a given date. Broadly speaking, it makes a distinction
between events of deforestation, degradation and logging. The data
extracted here spans from 2016 onward in the Amazon, and from 2018
onward in the Cerrado.

The raw DETER data shows one warning per row, with each row also
containing a municipality. However, many warnings actually overlap with
2 or up to 4 municipalities, which are not shown in the original data.
Therefore, when the option `raw_data = FALSE` is selected, the original
spatial information is intersected with a municipalities map of Brazil,
and each warning can be split into more than one row, with each row
corresponding to a municipality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: there are two options:
    - `"deter_amz"` for data from the Amazon
    - `"deter_cerrado"` for data from the Cerrado
2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:
    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.
3.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# Download treated data (raw_data = FALSE) from Amazonia (dataset = "deter_amz")
deter_amz <- load_deter(dataset = 'deter_amz',
                        raw_data = FALSE)
```

## DEGRAD

The [DEGRAD
project](http://www.obt.inpe.br/OBT/assuntos/programas/amazonia/degrad)
uses satellites to monitor degradation of forest areas. Raw data is
available as simple features (sf) objects, read from shapefiles. The
project was substituted in 2016 by DETER-B. Accordingly, data is
available from 2007 up to 2016.

Original documentation for this data is very scarce, users beware. Some
things to keep in mind are:

Event data is organized through yearly editions (DEGRAD 2007-2016).
Inside a given edition however, there may be data from different years
(events that happened in 2015 inside DEGRAD 2016 for example).

This package provides degradation data with municipality identification.
It does this by intersecting DEGRAD geometries with IBGE’s municipality
geometries from the year 2019. CRS metadata however is missing from the
original data source. A best effort approach is used and a CRS is
assumed
`(proj4string: "+proj=longlat +ellps=aust_SA +towgs84=-66.8700,4.3700,-38.5200,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0 +no_defs")`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: `"degrad"`

2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:

    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.

3.  **time_period**: picks the years for which the data will be
    downloaded

4.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# download treated data (raw_data = TRUE) related to forest degradation
# from 2010 to 2012 (time_period = 2010:2012). 
data <- load_degrad(dataset = 'degrad', 
                    raw_data = FALSE,
                    time_period = 2010:2012)
```

## Imazon

Loads data categorizing each municipality by the level of deforestation
pressure it faces. The categories used by Imazon have three levels,
ranging from 0 to 3.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: `"imazon_shp"`

2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:

    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.

3.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# Download treated data
data <- load_imazon(raw_data = FALSE)
```

🔴 This function uses the `googledrive` package to download data. In
case of authentication errors, see [googledrive](#googledrive).

## IBAMA

The dataset is originally from the Brazilian Institute of Environment
and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama), documenting environmental
embargoes and fines at the individual level from 2005 to the present
day. In addition, it is possible to download distributed and collected
fines from 1994 until the present day.

The function returns either the raw data or a data frame with aggregates
considering, for each time-location period, counts for total the number
of infractions, infractions that already went to trial, and number of
unique perpetrators of infractions. There are also two data frames
regarding distributed and collected fines across municipalities

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: there are three possible choices.

    - `"embargoed_areas"`: embargoed areas
    - `"distributed_fines"`: fines that have not been paid by
      individuals or corporations
    - `"collected_fines"`: fines that have been paid by individuals or
      corporations

2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:

    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.

3.  **states**: specifies for which states to download the data. It is
    “all” by default, but can be a single state such as `"AC"` or any
    vector such as `c("AC", "AM")`. Does not apply to the
    `"embargoed_areas"` dataset.

4.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
library(datazoom.amazonia)

# Download treated embargoes data (raw_data = FALSE) in english (language = "eng")
data <- load_ibama(dataset = "embargoed_areas", raw_data = FALSE, 
                   language = "eng")

# Download treated collected fines data from "BA"
data <- load_ibama(dataset = "collected_fines", raw_data = FALSE,
                   states = "BA", language = "pt")
```

## MAPBIOMAS

The MAPBIOMAS project gathers data reporting the type of land covering
each year by area, that is, for example, the area used for a temporary
crop of soybeans. It also reports the transition between coverings
during given years.

The data available has an yearly frequency and is available starting
from the year 1989.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**:

    - `"mapbiomas_cover"`: types of land cover
    - `"mapbiomas_transition"`: changes in land cover
    - `"mapbiomas_deforestation_regeneration"`: deforestation and forest
      regeneration
    - `"mapbiomas_irrigation"`: irrigated areas
    - `"mapbiomas_grazing_quality"`: grazing quality
    - `"mapbiomas_mining"`: areas used for mining
    - `"mapbiomas_water"`: areas of water surface
    - `"mapbiomas_fire"`: areas of wildfire burn scars

2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:

    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.

3.  **geo_level**:

    - For datasets `"mapbiomas_cover"`, `"mapbiomas_transition"`,
      `"mapbiomas_deforestation_regeneration"` and `"mapbiomas_fire"`,
      can be `"municipality"` or `"state"` (faster download).
    - For dataset `"mapbiomas_mining"`, can be `"indigenous_land"`,
      `"municipality"`, `"state"`, `"biome"` or `"country"`.
    - For dataset `"mapbiomas_irrigation"`, can be `"state"` or
      `"biome"`.
    - For dataset `"mapbiomas_water"`, can be `"municipality"`,
      `"state"` or `"biome"`.
    - Does not apply to other datasets.

4.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

5.  **cover_level**: Aggregates the data to some level of land coverage.
    Only applies to datasets `"mapbiomas_cover"` and
    `"mapbiomas_grazing_quality"`:

    - `cover_level = "none"`: no aggregation
    - `cover_level = 0`: least aggregated, with categories of Anthropic
      and Natural
    - `cover_level = 1`: categories such as Forest, Non Forest Natural
      Formation, Farming, Non Vegetated Area, Water, Non Observed
    - `cover_level = 2`: categories such as Agriculture, Aquaculture,
      Beach and Dune, Forest Plantation, Pasture, River, Lake and
      Ocean  
    - `cover_level = 3`: categories such as Aquaculture, Beach and Dune,
      Forest Formation, Forest Plantation
    - `cover_level = 4`: categories such as Aquaculture, Beach and Dune,
      Forest Formation, Forest Plantation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# download treated Mapbiomas Cover data in english at the highest aggregation level
data <- load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbiomas_cover",
                       raw_data = FALSE,
                       geo_level = "municipality",
                       language = "eng",
                       cover_level = 0)

# download treated Mapbiomas Transition data in portuguese
data <- load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbiomas_transition", raw_data = FALSE,
                       geo_level = "state", language = "pt")

# download treated data on mining on indigenous lands
data <- load_mapbiomas("mapbiomas_mining",
                       raw_data = FALSE,
                       geo_level = "indigenous_land")
```

## TerraClimate

# Downloading maximum temperature data from 2000 to 2001
max_temp <- load_climate(dataset = "max_temperature", time_period = 2000:2001)

# Downloading precipitation data only for the legal Amazon in 2010
amz_precipitation <- load_climate(dataset = "precipitation",
                                  time_period = 2010,
                                  legal_amazon_only = TRUE)
```

## SEEG

Loads estimates of emission of greenhouse gases of Brazilian cities and
states from SEEG. SEEG is the System of Estimates of Emissions and
Removals of Greenhouse Gases (SEEG), an initiative of the Observatório
do Clima, a network of institutions focused on climate change research
in Brazil.

The data provided in SEEG’s Collection 9 is a series covering the period
from 1970 to 2020, except for the Land Use Change Sector that has the
series from 1990 to 2020.

Using data collected from government entities, institutes, research
centers, NGOs and other institutions, the estimates are created using
the methodology of the Brazilian Inventory of Anthropic Emissions and
Removals of Greenhouse Gases, assembled by the Ministry of Science,
Technology and Innovation (MCTI), and the directives of
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)

Emissions are divided in five main sources: Agricultural and Cattle
Raising, Energy, Changes in Use of Land, Industrial Processes and
Residues. All greenhouse gases contained in the national inventory are
considered, encompassing CO2, CH4, N2O and the HFCs, with the conversion
to carbon equivalence (CO2e) also included, both in the metric of GWP
(Global Warming Potential) and GTP (Global Temperature Potential).

The data is downloaded from the SEEG website in the form of one single
file, so the option to select a certain range of years is not available.
Also, due to the size of the file, a stable internet connection is
necessary, and the function may take time to run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: there are six choices:

    - `"seeg"`: provides all sectors in a same dataframe. Only works
      with `raw_data = TRUE`
    - `"seeg_farming"`
    - `"seeg_industry"`
    - `"seeg_energy"`
    - `"seeg_land"`
    - `"seeg_residuals"`

2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:

    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.

3.  **geo_level**: `"country"`, `"state"`, or `"municipality"`

4.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# Download raw data (raw_data = TRUE) of greenhouse gases (dataset = "seeg") 
# by state (geo_level = "state")
data <- load_seeg(dataset = "seeg", 
                  raw_data = TRUE,
                  geo_level = "state")
  
# Download treated data (raw_data = FALSE) of industry greenhouse gases (dataset = "seeg_industry")
data <- load_seeg(dataset = "seeg_industry", 
                  raw_data = FALSE,
                  geo_level = "state")
```

🔴 This function uses the `googledrive` package to download data at the
municipality level. In case of authentication errors, see
[googledrive](#googledrive).

## CENSOAGRO

The census of agriculture collects information about agricultural

## DATASUS

DATASUS is the IT department of SUS – the Brazilian Unified Health
System. They provide data on health establishments, mortality, access to
health services and several health indicators nationwide. This function
allows for an easy download of several DATASUS raw datasets, and also
cleans the data in a couple of datasets. The sections below explains
each avaliable dataset.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**:

    - `"datasus_sim_do"` has SIM-DO mortality data
    - Possible subsets of SIM-DO are `"datasus_sim_dofet"` (Fetal),
      `"datasus_sim_doext"` (External causes), `"datasus_sim_doinf"`
      (Children), `"datasus_sim_domat"` (Maternal)
    - `"datasus_sih"` has SIH hospitalization data.
    - `"datasus_cnes_lt"` has data on the number of hospital beds.
    - further subsets of CNES are listed later, but those only allow for
      the download of raw data.

2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:

    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data. Only
      effective for SIM-DO and subsets, SIH, and CNES-LT.

3.  **keep_all**: only applies when raw_data is FALSE. There are two
    options:

    - `TRUE`: keeps all original variables, adding variable labels and
      possibly constructing extra variables.
    - `FALSE`: aggregates data at the municipality, thereby losing
      individual-level data, and only keeping aggregate measures.

4.  **time_period**: picks the years for which the data will be
    downloaded

5.  **states**: a vector of states by which to filter the data. Only
    works for datasets whose data is provided in separate files by
    state.

6.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### DATASUS - SIM (System of Mortality Information)

Each original SIM data file contains rows corresponding to a declaration
of death (DO), and columns with several characteristics of the person,
the place of death, and the cause of death. The data comes from the main
SIM-DO (Declarations of Death) dataset, which goes by the option
`"datasus_sim_do"`. There are also 4 subsets of SIM-DO, namely SIM-DOFET
(Fetal), SIM-DOMAT (Maternal), SIM-DOINF (Children), and SIM-DOEXT
(External Causes), with corresponding dataset options
`"datasus_sim_dofet", "datasus_sim_domat", "datasus_sim_doinf", "datasus_sim_doext"`.
Note that only SIM-DO provides separate files for each state, so all
other dataset options always contain data from the whole country.

Below is an example of downloading the raw data, and also using the
`raw_data = FALSE` option to obtain treated data. When this option is
selected, we create several variables for deaths from each cause, which
are encoded by their CID-10 codes. The function then returns, by
default, the aggregated data of mortality sources at the municipality
level. In this process, all the individual information such as age, sex,
race, and schooling are lost, so we also offer the option of
`keep_all = TRUE`, which creates all the indicator variables for cause
of death, adds variable labels, and does not aggregate, thereby keeping
all individual-level variables.

**Examples:**

``` r
library(datazoom.amazonia)

# download raw data for the year 2010 in the state of AM. 
data <- load_datasus(dataset = "datasus_sim_do",
                     time_period = 2010,
                     states = "AM",
                     raw_data = TRUE)

# download treated data with the number of deaths by cause in AM and PA.
data <- load_datasus(dataset = "datasus_sim_do",
                    time_period = 2010,
                    states = c("AM", "PA"),
                    raw_data = FALSE)

# download treated data with the number of deaths by cause in AM and PA
# keeping all individual variables.
data <- load_datasus(dataset = "datasus_sim_do",
                    time_period = 2010,
                    states = c("AM", "PA"),
                    raw_data = FALSE,
                    keep_all = TRUE)
```

##### DATASUS - CNES (National Register of Health Establishments)

Provides information on health establishments, avaliable hospital beds,
and active physicians. The data is split into 13 datasets: LT (Beds), ST
(Establishments), DC (Complimentary data), EQ (Equipment), SR
(Specialized services), HB (License), PF (Practitioner), EP (Teams), RC
(Contractual Rules), IN (Incentives), EE (Teaching establishments), EF
(Philanthropic establishments), and GM (Management and goals).

Raw data is avaliable for all of them using the dataset option
`datasus_cnes_lt, datasus_cnes_st`, and so on, and treated data is only
avaliable for CNES - LT. When `raw_data = FALSE` is chosen, we return
data on the number of total hospital beds and the ones avaliable through
SUS, which can be aggregated by municipality (with option
`keep_all = FALSE`) or keeping all original variables
(`keep_all = TRUE`).

**Examples:**

``` r
library(datazoom.amazonia)

# download treated data with the number of avaliable beds in AM and PA.
data <- load_datasus(dataset = "datasus_cnes_lt",
                    time_period = 2010,
                    states = c("AM", "PA"),
                    raw_data = FALSE)
```

##### DATASUS - SIH (System of Hospital Information)

Contains data on hospitalizations. Treated data only gains variable
labels, with no extra manipulation. Beware that this is a much heavier
dataset.

**Examples:**

``` r
library(datazoom.amazonia)

# download raw data
data <- load_datasus(dataset = "datasus_sih",
                    time_period = 2010,
                    states = "AM",
                    raw_data = TRUE)

# download data in a single tibble, with variable labels
data <- load_datasus(dataset = "datasus_sih",
                    time_period = 2010,
                    states = "AM",
                    raw_data = FALSE)
```

# Economic Data

## COMEX

The Comex dataset gathers data extracted from [Siscomex (Integrated
System of Foreign
Trade)](https://www.gov.br/produtividade-e-comercio-exterior/pt-br/assuntos/comercio-exterior/estatisticas/base-de-dados-bruta/),
which is a database containing information from all products that are
imported to or exported from Brazil. Using data reported from the
companies which are responsible for the process of transporting the
products, the system adheres to internationally standardized
nomenclatures, such as the Harmonized System and the Mercosul Common
Nomenclature (which pertains to members of the Mercosul organization).

The data has a monthly frequency and is available starting from the year
1989. From 1989 to 1996, a different system of nomenclatures was
adopted, but all conversions are available on a dictionary in the Comex
website
(<https://www.gov.br/produtividade-e-comercio-exterior/pt-br/assuntos/comercio-exterior/estatisticas/base-de-dados-bruta/>).
Systems of nomenclature vary in the degree of detail in terms of the
product involved, as well as other characteristics, such as unit and
granularity of location.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: there are four choices:

    - `"comex_export_mun"`: selects exports data by municipality

## PAM

[Municipal Agricultural
Production](https://www.ibge.gov.br/en/statistics/economic/agriculture-forestry-and-fishing/16773-municipal-agricultural-production-temporary-and-permanent-crops.html?=&t=o-que-e)
(PAM, in Portuguese) is a nationwide annual survey conducted by IBGE
(Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) which provides
information on agricultural products, such as quantity produced, area
planted and harvested, average quantity of output and monetary value of
such output. The products are divided in permanent and temporary farmed
land, as well as dedicated surveys to the four products that yield
multiple harvests a year (beans, potato, peanut and corn), which all sum
to a total survey of 64 agricultural products (31 of temporary tillage
and 33 of permanent tillage). Output, however, is only included in the
dataset if the planted area occupies over 1 acre or if output exceeds
one tonne.

Permanent farming is characterized by a cycle of long duration, whose
harvests may be done multiple times across the years without the need of
planting seeds again. Temporary farming, on the other hand, consists of
cycles of short and medium duration, which after harvesting require
planting seeds again.

The data also has multiple aggregation levels, such as nationwide, by
region, mesoregion and microregion, as well as state and municipality.

The data available has a yearly frequency and is available from 1974 to
the present, with the exception of the four multiple-harvest products,
which are only available from 2003. More information can be found on
[this
link](https://www.ibge.gov.br/estatisticas/economicas/agricultura-e-pecuaria/9117-producao-agricola-municipal-culturas-temporarias-e-permanentes.html#:~:text=A%20pesquisa%20Produ%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Agr%C3%ADcola%20Municipal,s%C3%A3o%20da%20cesta%20b%C3%A1sica%20do)

well as existing total and harvested areas of forest crops.

Data is from the Silviculture and Forestry Extraction Production (PEVS,
in Portuguese), a nationwide annual survey conducted by IBGE (Brazilian
Institute of Geography and Statistics). The data also has multiple
aggregation levels, such as nationwide, by region, mesoregion and
microregion, as well as state and municipality.

The data available has a yearly frequency and is available from 1986 to
the present, with the exception of the data on total area for
production, which are only available from 2013 onwards. More information
can be found in [this

## ANEEL

Loads data from the National Electrical Energy Agency (ANEEL), a
Brazilian independent federal agency linked to the Ministry of Mines and
Energy (MME). ANEEL works to provide favorable conditions for the
Electrical Energy Market to develop with balance and for the benefit of
society.

As for now, there are three different datasets available for download:
the Energy Development Budget and the Energy Generation.

#### Energy Development Budget

The Energy Development Budget dataset showcases the Energy Development
Account’s (CDE) anual budget expenses. The CDE is designed to promote
the Brazilian energy development and is managed by the Electrical Energy
Commercialization Chamber (CCEE).

The dataset makes available the year of the observation – from 2013 to
2022 –, the type of expense, its value in R\$ (Reais) and its share over
the total amount of CDE budget expenses on the year\*.

\*Note that ‘share_of_total’ values sum to 1 for each year available.

#### Energy Generation

The Energy Generation dataset showcases information about ANEEL’s
Generation Informations System (SIGA). SIGA provides information about
the Brazilian electrical energy generation installed capacity.

The dataset provides information at the individual venture/entity level.
It contains information about the power, source, stage, type of
permission, origin and final fuel with which each venture/entity
operates, as well as other legal, technical and geographical
information.\* Operation start dates contained in the dataset go as far
back as 1924 up to 2022.

\* For more details on each variable, access [This
link](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjc4OGYyYjQtYWM2ZC00YjllLWJlYmEtYzdkNTQ1MTc1NjM2IiwidCI6IjQwZDZmOWI4LWVjYTctNDZhMi05MmQ0LWVhNGU5YzAxNzBlMSIsImMiOjR9)
and select “Manual do Usuario”.

#### Energy Enterprises

The Energy Enterprises dataset showcases information about distributed
micro and mini generators, covered by the Regulatory Resolution nº
482/2012. The list of projects is classified by variables that make up
their identification, namely: connected distributor, project code,
numerical nucleus of the project code, owner name, production class,
subgroup, name of the owner, number of consumer units that receive
credits, connection date, type of generating unit, source, installed
power, municipality, and federative unit where it is located.

The data is expressed in quantities and installed power in kW
(kilowatt). The quantity corresponds to the number of distributed micro
or mini generators installed in the specified period. The installed
power is defined by the sum of the nominal active electric power of the
generating units.

\* For more details on each variable, access [This
link](https://dadosabertos.aneel.gov.br/dataset/relacao-de-empreendimentos-de-geracao-distribuida)
and select “Dicionário de dados”.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: there are three choices:
    - `"energy_development_budget"`: government spending towards energy
      sources
    - `"energy_generation"`: energy generation by entity/corporation
    - `"energy_enterprises_distributed"`: distributed micro and mini
      generators
2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:
    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.
3.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# download treated data about energy generation
clean_aneel <- load_aneel(
 dataset = "energy generation",
 raw_data = FALSE
)
```

## EPE

Loads data from the Energy Research Company (EPE), a Brazilian public
company that works closely with the Brazilian Ministry of Mines and
Energy (MME) and other agencies to ensure the sustainable development of
Brazil’s energy infrastructure. EPE’s duty on that mission is to support
MME with quality research and studies in order to aid Brazil’s energy
infrastructure planning.

As for now, there are two different datasets available for download: the
Energy Consumption Per Class and the National Energy Balance. Both of
them were obtained from the [EPE
website](https://www.epe.gov.br/sites-pt/publicacoes-dados-abertos/publicacoes/).

#### Energy Consumption Per Class

The Energy Consumption Per Class dataset provides monthly data about
energy consumption and consumers from 2004 to 2022, for each class of
energy consumption.

The different classes are Total consumption (and consumers), Industrial
consumption (and consumers), Residential consumption (and consumers),
Commercial consumption (and consumers), Captive consumption\* and Other
consumption (and consumers).\*\*

\*Note that there is no consumer data for ‘Captive’ class at all.

\*\*There is also no consumer data for ‘Industrial’, ‘Commercial’ and
‘Other’ classes when the geographical level is ‘Subsystem’ or ‘Region’.

There are three different aggregation levels: The Region level
encompasses the five Brazilian geographical regions (North, Northeast,
Midwest, Southeast and South). The Subsystem level encompasses the five
Brazilian Electric Subsystems (North, Northeast, Southeast/Midwest,
South, Isolated Systems). The State level encompasses the 26 Brazilian
States and the Federal District.

#### National Energy Balance

The National Energy Balance is a thorough and extensive research
developed and published by EPE that contains useful data about energy
consumption, generation, exportation and many more subjects.

As for now, the National Energy Balance dataset provides yearly data
about energy generation per source of production. The sources can be
divided into two groups: the renewable sources (hydro, wind, solar,
nuclear, thermal, sugar_cane_bagasse, firewood, black_liquor) and the
non-renewable sources (steam_coal, natural_gas, coke_oven_gas, fuel_oil,
diesel).

The dataset has information at the Brazilian state level, including the
Federal District, from 2011 to 2021 and also indicates whether the state
is in the Legal Amazon or not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Options:**

1.  **dataset**: there are two choices:
    - `"energy_consumption_per_class"`: monthly energy consumption and
      consumers by State, Region or Electric Subsystem
    - `"national_energy_balance"`: yearly energy generation per source,
      by State
2.  **raw_data**: there are two options:
    - `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
    - `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.
3.  **geo_level**: only applies to the `"energy_consumption_per_class"`
    dataset.
    - `"state"`
    - `"subsystem"`
4.  **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English
    `("eng")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Examples:**

``` r
# download treated data about energy consumption at the state level
clean_epe <- load_epe(
  dataset = "energy_consumption_per_class",
  geo_level = "state",
  raw_data = FALSE
)
```

# Other tools

## Legal Amazon Municipalities

Many of our functions use a dataset with Brazilian municipalities, their
municipality codes, whether they belong to the Legal Amazon, their
state, and some more variables. It was constructed from the [IBGE
spreadsheet](https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/cartas-e-mapas/mapas-regionais/15819-amazonia-legal.html?=&t=acesso-ao-produto)
with Legal Amazon municipalities, along with a data frame from the
‘geobr’ package. For more information on the columns, run
`??datazoom.amazonia::municipalities`.

``` r
# load Brazilian municipalities dataset
data <- datazoom.amazonia::municipalities
```

## <a name="googledrive"></a> The ‘googledrive’ package

For some of our functions, the original data is stored in Google Drive
and exceeds the file size limit for which direct downloads are possible.
As a result, the `googledrive` package is required to download the data
though the Google Drive API and run the function.

The first time the package is called, it requires you to link your
Google account and grant permissions to be able to download data through
the Google Drive API.

You **must** tick all boxes when the permissions page opens, or else the
following error will occur:

``` r
#Error in `gargle_abort_request_failed()`:
#! Client error: (403) Forbidden
#Insufficient Permission: Request had insufficient authentication scopes.
#• domain: global
#• reason: insufficientPermissions
#• message: Insufficient Permission: Request had insufficient authentication
#  scopes.
#Run `rlang::last_error()` to see where the error occurred.
```
