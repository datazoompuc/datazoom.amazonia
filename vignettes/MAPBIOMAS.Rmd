The MAPBIOMAS project gathers data reporting the type of land covering each year by area, that is, for example, the area used for a temporary crop of soybeans. It also reports the transition between coverings during given years.

The data available has an yearly frequency and is available starting from the year 1989.

```
1. dataset: There are fice possible choices.
'mapbiomas_cover': type of land covering by biomes, states and municipalities.
                  data is available from 1985 to 2020.
'mapbiomas_transition': transition between coverings by biomes, states and municipalities.
                        data is available from 1985 to 2020.
'mapbiomas_deforestation_regeneration': deforestation and regeneration by biomes and states. 
                                        data is available from 1988 to 2020.
'mapbiomas_irrigation': data about irrigation area by biomes and states.
                        data is available from 2000 to 2020
'mapbiomas_grazing_quality': data about grazing quality by biome, state and municipality
                             data is available from 2010 and 2018
'mapbiomas_mining': data about mining areas by biome, state, country, municipality and indigenous lands.
                             data is available from 1985 to 2020
2. raw_data: there are two options:
  # TRUE: if you want the data as it is in the mapbiomas's site.
  # FALSE: if you want the treated (more organized) version of the data. 
3. geo_level:  Does not apply to datasets not mentioned below
                # For datasets "mapbiomas_cover" and "mapbiomas_transition", can be  "municipality" or "state"
                # For dataset "mapbiomas_mining", can be "biome" or "indigenous_land"
4. language: you can choose between portuguese ('pt') and english ('eng')
5. cover_level: Aggregates the data to some level of land coverage. Only applies to datasets "mapbiomas_cover" and "mapbiomas_grazing_quality":
                # cover_level = "none" means no aggregation
                # cover_level = 0 has categories such as: Anthropic, Natural, Not Applied 
                # cover_level = 1 has categories such as: Forest, Non Forest Natural Formation, Farming, Non Vegetated Area, Water, Non Observed
                # cover_level = 2 has categories such as: Agriculture, Aquaculture, Beach and Dune, Forest Plantation,  Pasture, River, Lake and Ocean                                
                # cover_level = 3 has categories such as: Aquaculture, Beach and Dune, Forest Formation, Forest Plantation 
                # cover_level = 4 has categories such as: Aquaculture, Beach and Dune, Forest Formation, Forest Plantation 
```
 
```{r eval=FALSE}

                       raw_data = FALSE,

                       language = "eng",
                       cover_level = 0)
