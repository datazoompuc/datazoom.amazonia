## The Dataset

The MAPBIOMAS project gathers data reporting the type of land covering each year by area, that is, for example, the area used for a temporary crop of soybeans. It also reports the transition between coverings during given years.

The data available has an yearly frequency and is available starting from the year 1989.

## Usage
Using the function is easy enough:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(datazoom.amazonia)

# download treated Mapbiomas Cover data in english
data = load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbiomas_cover", raw_data = FALSE, time_period = "all",
                      language = "eng")

# download treated Mapbiomas Transition data in portuguese
data = load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbiomas_transition", raw_data = FALSE, time_period = "all",
                      language = "pt")

# download treated Mapbiomas Grazing Quality data in portuguese
data = load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbiomas_grazing_quality", raw_data = FALSE, time_period = "all", language = "pt")

# download treated Mapbiomas Irrigation data in english

data = load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbiomas_irrigation", raw_data = FALSE, time_period = "all", language = "eng")

# download treated Mapbiomas deforestauon/regeneration data in portuguese

data = load_mapbiomas(dataset = "mapbiomas_deforestation_regeneration", raw_data = FALSE, time_period = 2011, language = "eng")
```
