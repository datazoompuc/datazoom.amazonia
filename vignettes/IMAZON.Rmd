Loads data categorizing each municipality by the level of deforestation pressure it faces. The categories used by Imazon have three levels, ranging from 0 to 3.

***
**Options:**

  1. **dataset**: `"imazon_shp"`

  2. **raw_data**: there are two options:
      * `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
      * `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data.

  3. **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English `("eng")`
  
***

**Examples:**

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Download treated data
data <- load_imazon(raw_data = FALSE)
```
