**Examples:**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Download raw data (raw_data = TRUE) at the country level
# from 2008 to 2010 (time_period = 2008:2010).
data <- load_cempre(
  raw_data = TRUE,
  geo_level = "country", 
  time_period = 2008:2010
) 
# Download treted data (raw_data = FALSE) by state (geo_level = "state") 
# from 2008 to 2010 (time_period = 2008:2010) in portuguese (language = "pt").
# In this example, data is split by sector (sectors = TRUE)
data <- load_cempre(raw_data = FALSE,
                    geo_level = "state", 
                    time_period = 2008:2010,
                    language = "pt",
                    sectors = TRUE) 
```
