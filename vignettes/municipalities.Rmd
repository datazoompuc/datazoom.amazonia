Many of our functions use a dataset with Brazilian municipalities, their municipality codes, whether they belong to the Legal Amazon, their state, and some more variables. It was constructed from the [IBGE spreadsheet](https://www.ibge.gov.br/geociencias/cartas-e-mapas/mapas-regionais/15819-amazonia-legal.html?=&t=acesso-ao-produto) with Legal Amazon municipalities, along with a data frame from the 'geobr' package. For more information on the columns, run `??datazoom.amazonia::municipalities`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# load Brazilian municipalities dataset
data <- datazoom.amazonia::municipalities
```
