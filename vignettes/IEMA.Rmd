  2. raw_data: there are two options:
  # TRUE: if you want the data in its original form
  # FALSE: if you want the treated (more organized) version of the data.
  
  3. geo_level:
  # "municipality". The data is only available at the municipality level.
  
  4. language: you can choose between portuguese ('pt') and english ('eng')
```
