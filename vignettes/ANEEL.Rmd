**Options:**

  1. **dataset**: there are two choices:
      * `"energy_development_budget"`: government spending towards energy sources
      * `"energy_generation"`: energy generation by source

  2. **raw_data**: there are two options:
      * `TRUE`: if you want the data as it is originally.
      * `FALSE`: if you want the treated version of the data. 

  3. **language**: you can choose between Portuguese `("pt")` and English `("eng")`

**Examples:**  
  
```{r eval=FALSE}
# download treated data about energy generation
clean_aneel <- load_aneel(
 dataset = "energy generation",
 raw_data = FALSE
)
```
