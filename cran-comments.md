  Package was archived on CRAN
  
  CRAN repository db overrides:

    Maintainer is a not a single person. Also, reauires flaky packages
      sidrdr and geobr.
      
  * Maintainer has been changed and package is no longer dependent on the (now archived) package 'geobr'.   

> On windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
  checking for detritus in the temp directory ... NOTE
  Found the following files/directories:
    'lastMiKTeXException'
    
  * Seems to be a common note, but it doesn't appear on other checks besides `devtools::check_win_devel()` and `rhub::check_for_cran()`.
  * GitHub Actions checks and local `devtools::check()` display no errors, warnings, or notes.
