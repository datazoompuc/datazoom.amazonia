The goal of package datazoom.amazonia is to facilitate access to official data about agriculture, deforestation, production and other activities in the Brazilian Amazon.The package provides functions that download and pre-process selected datasets. Our users should know that our functions pull data from databases from other institutions and therefore if one of these institutions decides to stop sharing their data with the public then there's nothing we can do about it. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

## 2 - COMEX data

The Comex dataset gathers data extracted from Siscomex (Integrated System of Foreign Trade), which is a database containing information from all products that are imported to or exported from Brazil. Using data reported from the companies which are responsible for the process of transporting the products, the system adheres to internationally standardized nomenclatures, such as the Harmonized System and the Mercosul Common Nomenclature (which pertains to members of the Mercosul organization). 

The data has a monthly frequency and is available starting from the year 1989. From 1989 to 1996, a different system of nomenclatures was adopted, but all conversions are available on a dictionary in the Comex website (https://www.gov.br/produtividade-e-comercio-exterior/pt-br/assuntos/comercio-exterior/estatisticas/base-de-dados-bruta/).

### PAM

Municipal Agricultural Production (PAM, in Portuguese) is a nationwide annual survey conducted by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) which provides information on agricultural products, such as quantity produced, area planted and harvested, average quantity of output and monetary value of such output. The products are divided in permanent and temporary farmed land, as well as dedicated surveys to the four products that yield multiple harvests a year (beans, potato, peanut and corn), which all sum to a total survey of 64 agricultural products (31 of temporary tillage and 33 of permanent tillage). Output, however, is only included in the dataset if the planted area occupies over 1 acre or if output exceeds one tonne. 

```
There are five parameters in this function:
  
  1. dataset: There are seven possible choices. 
  These datasets contain statistics such as quantity produced, area planted and harvested, average quantity of output and monetary value of such output. 
  
  # 'pam_all_crops': it selects data about agricultural products divided in permanent and temporary farmed land. 
  # 'pam_permanent_crops': it selects the data about agricultural products produced in permanent farmed land.
  # 'pam_temporary_crops':it selects the data about agricultural products produced in temporary farmed land.
  # 'pam_corn': it selects the data from the first and the second harvests of corn.
  # 'pam_potato': it selects the data from the first, the second and the third harvests of potato.
  # 'pam_peanut': it selects the data from the first and the second harvests of peanut.
  # 'pam_beans':  it selects the data from the first, the second and the third harvests of bean.
  2. raw_data: there are two options:
  # TRUE: if you want the data as it is in the IBGE's site.
  # FALSE: if you want the treated (more organized) version of the data. 
  3. geo_level: there are four options:
  # "country"
  # "region"
  # "state" 
  # "municipality"
  4. time_period:
  # For pam_all_crops, pam_permanent_crops and pam_temporary_crops, data is available from 1974 to 2019.
  # For pam_corn, pam_potato, pam_peanut and pam_beans, data is avaiable from 2003 to 2019.

## The Structure of the functions

**1. Bind Global Variables:** The goal is to ensure that all the variables in the function were initialized to some value. We also do this to avoid errors when we check the function.

**2. Define Basic Parameters:** Create a list with all the parameters from the function. The list *param* will be an organized list with all the parameters of interest.

**3. Download Data:** In the majority of our functions, we download data by using external_download(). However, when we download data from IBGE, we use a function called sidra_download(). Both of these functions can be found in the "download.R" file. 

**4. Data Engineering:** In this section of the code, we (i) exclude variables that we judge not to be relevant;(ii) sometimes we change the class of some variables; (iii) sometimes we change data to be organized in the long format or in the wide format depending on what we want; (iv) generally speaking, it's in this part of the code that we make the most changes in the original Data Frame.  

**5. Harmonizing Variable Names:** Rename columns with better names. 

**6. Load Dictionary:** In the functions that work with IBGE's data, we use the function "load_dictionary()". This function creates an organized correspondence between the code of each product, its name, its unit of measure and other attributes. 

**7. Translation / add variables:** After having organized the Data Frame, we then translate it.  In some functions, the translation will start in a section called "Labelling" and data from the "dictionary.R" file will be used. In other functions, you will see the names of the columns being translated first and then each line of the original Data Frame will be translated.

**8. Return Data Frame:** In the structure of our functions, you will see **(raw_data == TRUE){return(dat)}** right after "Downloading Data". All the changes explained in this document will only happen in case the user specifies **(raw_data == FALSE)**. 

## Examples

**1. Bind Global Variables:** example from *load_cempre()*

```{r}
sidra_code <- available_time <- AMZ_LEGAL <- municipio_codigo <- ano <- ano_codigo <- classificacao_nacional_de_atividades_economicas_cnae_2_0_codigo <- geo_id <- id_code <- nivel_territorial <- nivel_territorial_codigo <- valor <- variavel <- unidade_de_medida <- unidade_de_medida_codigo <- NULL
```

**2. Define Basic Parameters:** example from *load_deter()*

```{r}
# param=list()
#  param$dataset = dataset
#  param$time_period = time_period
#  param$language = language
#  param$raw_data = raw_data
#  param$survey_name = datasets_link() %>%
#    dplyr::filter(dataset == param$dataset) %>%
#    dplyr::select(survey) %>%
#    unlist()
#  param$url = datasets_link() %>%
#    dplyr::filter(dataset == param$dataset) %>%
#    dplyr::select(link) %>%
#    unlist()
```

**3. Download Data:** example from *load_degrad()*. It uses the *external_download()* function.

```{r}
# dat = suppressWarnings(as.list(param$time_period) %>%
#      purrr::map(
#        function(t){external_download(dataset = param$dataset,
#                                      source='degrad', year = t) %>%
#            janitor::clean_names()
#        }
#      ))
```

**4. Data Engineering**: example from *load_pam()*. In this process, we decided to exclude some columns and convert the variable "valor" to become numeric. After that we excluded all the lines with **NA**. 

```{r}
# dat = dat %>%
#           janitor::clean_names() %>%
#           dplyr::mutate_all(function(var){stringi::stri_trans_general(str=var,id="Latin-ASCII")})# %>%
          # dplyr::mutate_all(clean_custom)
#   dat = dat %>%
#     dplyr::select(-c(nivel_territorial_codigo,nivel_territorial,ano_codigo)) %>%
#     dplyr::mutate(valor=as.numeric(valor))
#   dat = dat %>%
#     dplyr::filter(!is.na(valor))
```

**5. Harmonizing Variable Names:** example from *load_pam()*. We localize some datasets by using their numerical codes and within each of these datasets we renamed some columns.

```{r}
# if (param$code == 5457){
#     dat = dat %>%
#       dplyr::rename(produto_das_lavouras_codigo = produto_das_lavouras_temporarias_e_permanentes_codigo,
#                     produto_das_lavouras = produto_das_lavouras_temporarias_e_permanentes)
#   }
#   if (param$code == 1613){
#     dat = dat %>%
#       dplyr::rename(produto_das_lavouras_codigo = # produto_das_lavouras_permanentes_codigo,
#                     produto_das_lavouras = produto_das_lavouras_permanentes)
#   }
#   if (param$code %in% c(839,1000,1001,1002,1612)){
#     dat = dat %>%
#       dplyr::rename(produto_das_lavouras_codigo = # produto_das_lavouras_temporarias_codigo,
#                   produto_das_lavouras = produto_das_lavouras_temporarias)
#   }
```

**6. Load Dictionary:** example from *load_pam()*. For functions with data from IBGE, we load the dictionary and then we convert the variable "var_code" to become a character. Finally we exclude the observations where var_code == "0".

```{r}
# dic = load_dictionary(param$dataset)
#  types = as.character(dic$var_code)
#  types = types[types != "0"] 
```

**7. Translation / add variables:** example from *load_degrad()*.This section translates the names of the columns of the original Data Frame.In this example, the original columns (variables) were in English and therefore we translated it to Portuguese in case the user chooses it.

```{r}
# if (param$language == 'pt'){
#    dat_mod = dat %>%
#      dplyr::select(ano = year, linkcolumn, scene_id,
#                    cod_uf = code_state, cod_municipio = code_muni,
#                    classe = class_name, pathrow, area, data = view_date,
#                    julday, geometry
#      ) %>%
#      dplyr::arrange(ano, cod_municipio, classe)
#  }
```
